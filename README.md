# Interactive Portfolio Website 
By Gurpreet Kullar --- V- 0.0002---

## Description
This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface and efficient functionality to showcase development skills.

## Wins and difficulties in this project
### Wins
- Successfully implemented a responsive dark mode toggle with smooth transitions
- Created an engaging 3D particle animation background using ThreeJS
- Built a clean and modern UI with consistent styling across components
- Integrated multiple interactive projects showcasing different skills
- Implemented proper accessibility features and semantic HTML structure

### Difficulties and Solutions
- **ThreeJS Learning Curve**: Initially challenging to understand 3D concepts and ThreeJS implementation. Overcame this by following tutorials and documentation thoroughly.
- **Responsive Design Challenges**: Had to carefully plan media queries and flexible layouts to ensure consistent appearance across devices. Used CSS Grid and Flexbox effectively to solve this.
- **Dark Mode Implementation**: Managing color schemes and transitions required careful planning. Created a comprehensive CSS variable system to handle theme switching smoothly.
- **Performance Optimization**: The 3D background initially caused performance issues on mobile devices. Optimized by reducing particle count and adjusting animation complexity based on device capabilities.

## Features
I will have all the screen shots in the screenshots folders in assets.

- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that works on all device sizes:

-- assets\Screenshots\Darkmode.png


- **Interactive Projects**:
  - Random Image Loader:

--- **Extra feature I added is a link to a website called "Rooms" where I have created a room using the UI and can also code to design a 3D room. I thought just to share with you as it was fun to create that in that website and has endless possibilities.

- **Modern UI**: Clean and professional design with smooth animations on main banner Using ThreeJS library.

- **Contact Section**: Easy way for visitors to get in touch. *MAYBE*


## Project Summary

This portfolio website has been both a challenging and rewarding journey in my web development learning process. The project started as a way to showcase my skills but evolved into a comprehensive learning experience about modern web technologies and best practices.

Working with ThreeJS for the 3D background animation was particularly challenging — I spent a lot of hours debugging particle rendering and optimizing performance. While frustrating at times, successfully implementing the smooth particle effects felt incredibly satisfying. The countless YouTube tutorials and documentation deep-dives were worth it in the end.

I have added multiple API in the website that worked after signing up for the respictive APIs. The free api provide around 1000 clicks which are enough for this project. I created the js part first and then did the html and css. I was not sure if I had the designs initially would that helped in any way. I also created the tips calculator in this website as well.

The dark mode implementation also proved trickier than expected. Getting the color transitions to work smoothly across all elements required careful planning of the CSS variables system. However, seeing the seamless theme switching in action made the effort worthwhile. I had to revisit and fix this part every time I added something new to the website. My CSS file never looked bigger. I used AI when I absolutely couldn’t pinpoint the issue. Overall, it was a great experience to learn from.

Some other frustrations included:

- Mobile responsiveness requiring multiple iterations to get right
- Cross-browser compatibility issues, especially with the 3D animations
- Performance optimization being more complex than anticipated — and still is, especially when loading multiple pictures in the loader
- Initial struggles with proper project structure and organization

--But the wins definitely outweighed the challenges:

- Successfully built my first fully responsive portfolio
- Gained a deep understanding of ThreeJS and 3D web graphics
- Implemented a clean, maintainable code structure
- Created an engaging user experience with smooth interactions

The hands-on experience with modern web technologies and real-world problem-solving has been invaluable for my development journey.
